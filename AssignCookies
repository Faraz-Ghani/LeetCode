/*
   Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. 
   But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

   Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with;
   and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i,
   and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output 
   the maximum number.
